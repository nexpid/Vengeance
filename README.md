## ❓ What is Vengeance?

**Vengeance**[^1] is a **proof-of-concept in-beta fork** of [Revenge Rewrite](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-rewrite), inspired by [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord)

## ❓ How do I use Vengeance?

You got here early! There's currently no way to use Vengeance without building it yourself :P

## ❓ I encountered an issue! How do I report it?

Ping **@nexpid** in the Revenge Discord for further help. You can also [create an issue](https://github.com/nexpid/Vengeance/issues/new), but reporting through Discord is usually faster.
